# Preparation

## Models

I just download the models from the [ChilloutMix | Stable Diffusion Checkpoint | Civitai](https://civitai.com/models/6424/chilloutmix). Thanks to the author TASUKU, and please follow the terms of usage.

## Environment

I loading the `.ckpt` checkpoint model file with Pytorch. So it is quite necessary to install and configure the Pytorch(-GPU) environment.
